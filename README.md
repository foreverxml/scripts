## Python
### Finding Primes
Finding Primes is a Python script to find primes. 

## Bash
### Benchmarker
Benchmarker uses [Finding Primes](#finding-primes) to benchmark your computer performance. It runs all 4 Primes scripts (10k, 100k, 200k, 500k) and saves everything to a file called `benchmarker.md`. (Note you have to enter the results; I am not that good at concat and splicing in bash!)
